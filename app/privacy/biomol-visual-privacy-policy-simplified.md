# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 1, 2025

## Hello from Biomol Visual

We're Biomol Visual LLP, and we create molecular animations for biotech companies. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you visit our website or work with us.

We know privacy matters, especially in biotech where confidentiality is everything. Here's our straightforward approach to protecting your information.

## Information We Collect

### When You Contact Us

If you fill out our contact form or email us, we collect:
- Your name and email
- Your company name
- Your phone number (if provided)
- Whatever you write in your message

### When You Visit Our Website

Our website automatically collects:
- Your IP address (this is standard for all websites)
- What pages you visit
- What browser you're using
- How you found us (Google search, direct link, etc.)

We use Google Analytics to understand our website traffic. It's anonymous data that helps us improve our site.

### When You Become a Client

If we work together, we'll also collect:
- Billing information
- Project details and scientific data
- Communications about your project

## How We Use Your Information

Here's what we do with your information:

- **Respond to your inquiries** - If you contact us, we'll use your info to reply
- **Send project updates** - If you're a client, we'll keep you informed
- **Improve our website** - Analytics help us understand what's working
- **Process payments** - For client invoicing
- **Send newsletters** - Only if you explicitly sign up

We don't sell your information. Ever. We don't share it with third parties for marketing. We're a small team focused on making great animations, not playing games with your data.

## Protecting Client Confidentiality

This is critical for us. When you share scientific data:

- **We sign NDAs** before you share anything confidential
- **Access is restricted** to only team members working on your project
- **Files are encrypted** during storage and transfer
- **We delete files** when you ask us to after project completion

Your scientific breakthroughs stay confidential. Period.

## Cookies

Our website uses cookies (small text files) for:
- **Google Analytics** - Understanding website usage
- **Basic functionality** - Remembering your preferences

You can block cookies in your browser settings. The website will still work fine.

## Who We Share Information With

We only share your information with:

- **Service providers we need to run our business:**
  - Payment processors (for invoicing)
  - Cloud storage (for file delivery)
  - Email services (for communication)
  
- **Legal requirements:**
  - If legally required by court order or law enforcement (this has never happened)

These services are contractually required to protect your data and only use it to provide their service.

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Ask what information we have** about you
- **Request corrections** if something's wrong
- **Ask us to delete your information** (unless we legally need to keep it)
- **Opt out of marketing emails** (there's an unsubscribe link in every email)

We keep your information only as long as needed:
- **Client projects:** Duration of project plus any agreed retention
- **Contact inquiries:** 2 years
- **Newsletter subscribers:** Until you unsubscribe
- **Website analytics:** 26 months (Google Analytics default)

## Security

No system is perfect, but we take security seriously and follow industry best practices.
