      quote: "Working with Biomol Visual has been a great advantage for Abcore. It has allowed us to work with marketing experts who are interested in the success and growth of our company, without having to hire additional employees. Abcore can go to Biomol Visual with ideas of marketing campaigns we are thinking about starting, budget them accordingly, and focus on executing the campaigns as quickly and efficiently as possible. There is no lag time of hiring and training a new employee. There is no digging through the internet trying to find out how to do something. Biomol Visual knows and can start immediately. Their work has increased our lead generation considerably, and has allowed us to spend more of our marketing budget on marketing, not experimenting. Biomol Visual helped us first with making a video to describe our flagship product, but just as importantly helped us to setup a landing page and advertising campaign to put the movie in front of as many potential customers as possible.",

We needed only minor adjustments before accepting the final version. The video was an excellent touch at IMMUNOLOGY 2017, one of our main annual conferences. It is also helping with our product-specific webpages and marketing material. Biomol Visual did excellent background research before presenting a proposal. They also arranged a thorough discussion before proceeding with the project, had excellent understanding of the scientific concept of the product, were very responsive to suggestions during development, and gave a fair price. Thanks a lot to the entire team. Hopefully this won't be our only project!",

We were fortunate to get a referral from our web designer firm to the talented team at Biomol Visual. They quickly assessed our needs and provided sample products from previous clients, as well as rough mock ups specific to our project. Once we had a contract in place, their talented script writer Pia worked with us to assemble video scripts and then story boards. Once the story boards were finalized, the animation phase moved quickly as Marcin used his background in biology together with animation skills to produce three separate videos that are visually stunning and tell our stories well. Biomol Visual is a unique group of people that should be the go to group for producing biology-related videos for pharmaceutical and biotech companies of any size.
