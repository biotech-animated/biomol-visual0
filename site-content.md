## Differentiation Section

**Headline:**
We Don't Show Procedures. We Show Molecular and Cellular Processes.

**Body Content:**

Generalist medical animation studios divide their attention across the entire medical spectrum. The same team that works on a project showing orthopedic implants in the morning pivots to dental procedures after lunch, then attempts to decode complex molecular pathways by end of day. Each project requires fundamentally different expertise, visual languages, and scientific understanding.

The problem this creates is clear: teams that constantly switch contexts never develop deep expertise in any single domain. They can't anticipate the questions investors will want answered about your specific molecular and cellular science. They're learning on your timeline—and your budget.

We only do one thing: **Visually explain the molecular and cellular science that gets you funded.** This singular focus is our advantage.

Our PhD scientists understand your molecular and cellular Mechanism of Action (MOA) in one call. No wasted time explaining the basics. This deep focus also means fewer errors from the start, which leads to vastly minimized corrections from your board.

**Featured Quote:**
"The team understands science and biotech, so communication is direct and effective — no wasting time bringing designers up to speed."
— Dr. James Campbell, CEO, Patrys

**Closing Line:**
Just a smarter process. And a more powerful result.

## Client Testimonials

### Abcore - David Barraclough, CEO
"Working with Biomol Visual has been a great advantage for Abcore."

Full quote: "Working with Biomol Visual has been a great advantage for Abcore. It has allowed us to work with marketing experts who are interested in the success and growth of our company, without having to hire additional employees. Abcore can go to Biomol Visual with ideas of marketing campaigns we are thinking about starting, budget them accordingly, and focus on executing the campaigns as quickly and efficiently as possible. There is no lag time of hiring and training a new employee. There is no digging through the internet trying to find out how to do something. Biomol Visual knows and can start immediately. Their work has increased our lead generation considerably, and has allowed us to spend more of our marketing budget on marketing, not experimenting. Biomol Visual helped us first with making a video to describe our flagship product, but just as importantly helped us to setup a landing page and advertising campaign to put the movie in front of as many potential customers as possible."

### University of Oxford - Tom Brown, Professor of Nucleic Acid Chemistry
"The final product was truly excellent and it was a key element in helping us to win a major competition."

Full quote: "We needed a video to explain and demonstrate some complex technology that we have developed in the DNA field, and we approached Biomol Visual for help. From the beginning of the process they were very engaged, understanding the principles of the technology and suggesting innovative ways to illustrate the key concepts. The project had a short deadline and they acted quickly and were prompt and helpful when we requested a series of small changes. The final product was truly excellent and it was a key element in helping us to win a major competition."

Full quote: "As part of our company website revamping process, our CEO charged us with producing a series of short videos to highlight our company and programs. We were fortunate to get a referral from our web designer firm to the talented team at Biomol Visual. They quickly assessed our needs and provided sample products from previous clients, as well as rough mock ups specific to our project. Once we had a contract in place, their talented script writer Pia worked with us to assemble video scripts and then story boards. Once the story boards were finalized, the animation phase moved quickly as Marcin used his background in biology together with animation skills to produce three separate videos that are visually stunning and tell our stories well. Biomol Visual is a unique group of people that should be the go to group for producing biology-related videos for pharmaceutical and biotech companies of any size. We would happily use their services again."

## Final CTA Section

**Headline:**
Stop Explaining. Start Showing.

**Body Content:**

Every day without a powerful fundraising asset, the cost of a complex story grows.

- Investors struggle to grasp your science.
- Potential partners miss your key competitive advantage.
- Your momentum is lost in a loop of re-explaining the core science.
- Competitors with clearer stories win the funding that should be yours.

One powerful fundraising asset solves all of this.
